Using the previous Solar Shading Analysis as an input, I'd like to find areas where we have not been able to predict production well.

Since the homes identified in the previous analysis are likely undeperforming due to shading rather than overall production, I'll eliminate them from the analysis set.

Clusters of systems that have low/high production vs. forecasts:
1) Find underperforming systems relative to predictions, cluster them geographically.  Find clusters within a X mile radius that are underperforming/overperforming which may be in a microclimate.  

Supplemental Analyses:
2) Distance from Weather Station, contribution to overall error?  Station by station?
3) Closest Weather Station best fit?
